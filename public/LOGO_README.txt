LOGO PLACEHOLDER

To add your logo:
1. Export your Zoxima SalesBuddy AI logo as PNG
2. Name it "logo.png" 
3. Place it in this /public folder
4. Recommended size: 280x80 pixels (or 560x160 for retina)

For now, the site uses logo.svg as a placeholder.

Update components/layout/Header.tsx to use PNG:
  Change: src="/logo.svg"
  To:     src="/logo.png"
